Bakctracking:
-> Algorithmic technique.
-> Recursively trying to build a solution.
-> Searching the entire search space to solve a computational problem.

Problem types:
-> Decision type (check for feasible solution)
-> Optimisation Problem (find best solution)
-> Enumeration Problem (find all solutions)


Classical Problem on Bakctracking:
-> Rat in a maze.
-> Sudoko solver.
-> N Queen.
-> Knight's Tour.


Bakctracking steps are written after the recursive function call.

**** All STL container are passed to function by value. So dont forget to pass em by reference.
