Binary tree is a hierarchical data structure that maintains hierarchy using node and edges.
Every node in a binary tree can have atmost 2 children.

Important Terms:
-> root
-> child
-> parent
-> sibling
-> leaf
-> ancestors
-> descendents
-> path
-> depth (The depth of a node is the number of edges present in path from the root node of a tree to that node.)

-> height (The height of a node is the number of edges present in the longest path connecting that node to a leaf node.)


-> Diameter: The larget distance between any two nodes of the tree. 


Common operation:
-> Creating tree
-> searching
-> tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)

Things to note:
-> Tree problems follow a recursive structure.
-> Fairly important topic for interviews.
-> Mostly all problems can be solved by dividing the problem into subproblems and making recursive calls on subtrees or iteratively.
