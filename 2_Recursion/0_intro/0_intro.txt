Recursion: Recursion is a technique where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same 
---------
problem.

Base Case: Base case is a point where the problem cannot be broken down any further and base case is the case where we 
----------
know the answer to the subproblem.  


When we are dealing with recursion we see two directions:
    ==> Towards the base case. (Top to down)
    ==> From the base case. (Bottom to top)


Steps for solving a problem using recursion:

1. Figure out the smallest case.
2. Always assume the subproblem can be solved.
3. Solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution exists.

All recursive problem will take up extra space because of implicit stack.

Time and space complexity of recusive solutions:
-----------------------------------------------

Time complexity: No of function calls and time taken for each function calls.
Space complexity: Maximum utilization of call stack for the max depth of function calls.
